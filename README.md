## Overview
This is a first look at a completed Node.JS file by me. With this you are able to craft a webpage deployable through Node.js to show the Managers, Engineers, and Interns on your team.
## Installation
You will need to install inquirer, jest, and node (if not already downloaded) install packages to run this app.
## Html changes
Added a standard index.html mockup draft to better assist with building the page-template.js file. 
# CSS changes
Added few CSS stylings since HTML contained bootstrap link sources.

## Credits
I want to thank Carlos and Anthony for assisting me over the hurdles of this project. Without Carlos hammering out a final few things I was missing, I wouldn't have been able to make this application work, really was helpful.
